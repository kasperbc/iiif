# iiif (Incredibly Inconvenient Image Format)
One time I looked at an image file, and thought _"you know, why are images so large? they're just a bunch of pixels"_. The result of that is iiif _(pronounced e-e-e-f)_, an attempt to create some kind of image format.

This is not meant to be utilized in any kind of useful way, but if you want to do something with it for whatever reason, it is MIT licensed.

## Features
* Over 3900% the image size, turn a 189KB jpg into a 7.5MB iiif file!
* No compression applied, retain the quality your masterpiece in it's full glory!
* Absolutely no third party support, you will not be able to view your images!
* No support for transparency!
* Written in the slowest programming language, Python

## Usage
Uhh install [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/basic-installation.html) and run `encode.py` I guess? I'm not teaching you how to use Python
